He is best known for his discovery of the principle of electromagnetic induction and the laws of electrolysis.In Experimental Researches in Electricity, first published in three volumes between 1839 and 1855, Faraday discusses the inquiries that led to his development of the first dynamo (the precursor of modern dynamos and generators), and his establishment of the foundations of classical field theory. His descriptions contain scarcely a hint of mathematics, and he relates the progress of his experiments in direct, clear language. Using the primitive tools available to him in his time, in conjunction with his great imaginative gifts, Faraday explains how he arrived at his profound conclusions with stunning simplicity."The writing is interesting and the expositions are impressive." — Florida Scientist. 1914 edition.},

	title = {Cosmic Rays at Earth},
	isbn = {9780444507105},
	abstract = {In 1912 Victor Franz Hess made the revolutionary discovery that ionizing radiation is incident upon the Earth from outer space. He showed with ground-based and balloon-borne detectors that the intensity of the radiation did not change significantly between day and night. Consequently, the sun could not be regarded as the sources of this radiation and the question of its origin remained unanswered. Today, almost one hundred years later the question of the origin of the cosmic radiation still remains a mystery.Hess' discovery has given an enormous impetus to large areas of science, in particular to physics, and has played a major role in the formation of our current understanding of universal evolution. For example, the development of new fields of research such as elementary particle physics, modern astrophysics and cosmology are direct consequences of this discovery. Over the years the field of cosmic ray research has evolved in various directions: Firstly, the field of particle physics that was initiated by the discovery of many so-called elementary particles in the cosmic radiation. There is a strong trend from the accelerator physics community to reenter the field of cosmic ray physics, now under the name of astroparticle physics. Secondly, an important branch of cosmic ray physics that has rapidly evolved in conjunction with space exploration concerns the low energy portion of the cosmic ray spectrum. Thirdly, the branch of research that is concerned with the origin, acceleration and propagation of the cosmic radiation represents a great challenge for astrophysics, astronomy and cosmology. Presently very popular fields of research have rapidly evolved, such as high-energy gamma ray and neutrino astronomy. In addition, high-energy neutrino astronomy may soon initiate as a likely spin-off neutrino tomography of the Earth and thus open a unique new branch of geophysical research of the interior of the Earth. Finally, of considerable interest are the biological and medical aspects of the cosmic radiation because of it ionizing character and the inevitable irradiation to which we are exposed. This book is a reference manual for researchers and students of cosmic ray physics and associated fields and phenomena. It is not intended to be a tutorial. However, the book contains an adequate amount of background materials that its content should be useful to a broad community of scientists and professionals. The present book contains chiefly a data collection in compact form that covers the cosmic radiation in the vicinity of the Earth, in the Earth's atmosphere, at sea level and underground. Included are predominantly experimental but also theoretical data. In addition the book contains related data, definitions and important relations. The aim of this book is to offer the reader in a single volume a readily available comprehensive set of data that will save him the need of frequent time consuming literature searches.},

	abstract = {{HiRes} utilizes a superior method of observing showers by combining two detectors to view showers in stereoscopic mode. The energy spectrum of ultra high energy cosmic rays measured using the {HiRes} detector in stereoscopic mode is described. Energies from 1018 {eV} and above are measured. Several different models are fit to the reconstructed spectrum. Well known features of the cosmic ray spectrum, including the ankle and the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min ({GZK}) suppression are observed. The ankle is found to be at 18.55 +/- 0.04 stat+0.07 -0.02 (sys) log10({eV}) and the {GZK} suppression at 19.76 +/- 0.04 stat+0.01 -0.16 (sys) log10({eV}). The spectral indices are also measured and found to be 3.31 +/- 0.03 stat+0.03 -0.06 (sys) below the ankle, 2.84 +/- 0.04 stat+0.01 -0.02 (sys) between the ankle and the {GZK} suppression, and 6.8 +/- 1.5 stat+0.0 -1.4 (sys) above the {GZK} suppression. The measured number of events above 1019.76 {eV} is compared to an expected number of events, assuming no {GZK} suppression. The significance of the {GZK} suppression is measured in this way to be 3.7 standard deviations.},

They are the result of millions of high energy reactions in the atmosphere and can be described as the superposition of hadronic and electromagnetic cascades. The hadronic cascade is the air shower backbone, and it is mainly made of pions. Decays of neutral pions initiate electromagnetic cascades, while the decays of charged pions produce muons which leave the hadronic core and travel many kilometers almost unaffected. Muons are smoking guns of the hadronic cascade: the energy, transverse momentum, spatial distribution and depth of production are key to reconstruct the history of the air shower. In this work, we overview the phenomenology of muons on the air shower and its relation to the hadronic cascade. We briefly review the experimental efforts to analyze muons within air showers and discuss possible paths to use this information.},

More precisely, geomagnetic cutoff rigidities predict the energetic charged particle transmission through the magnetosphere to a specific location as a function of direction. The generally accepted manner for determining cutoff rigidities is by the method of tracing particle trajectories in model magnetospheres. However, the trajectory-tracing process is so computer intensive that in the interest of economy, many approximations are still utilized. The use of modifications of the Störmer equation (with an appropriate magnetic coordinate system) is sufficient for many applications. However, for precise experimental measurements, cutoff rigidities determined by the trajectory-tracing method must be utilized.},

Cluster data are not included in the T01 database and therefore can be used to independently verify the model. The model performs very well in a global sense; nevertheless, absolute residuals between the data and the model can reach ∼20 {nT} near perigee. These deviations take two forms: a sharp, bipolar signature and well-defined trends over a larger spatial region. The bipolar signatures in the residuals are moderately stable, repeating on the phase period of the Cluster orbit. The bipolar nature of the signatures reflects variations in the Cluster data, therefore indicating that the spacecraft may be observing a field-aligned current. Although the size of the magnetic field perturbation in this region is not well determined by T01, the location of the observed field-aligned current system is accurately predicted. The bipolar signatures are observed in close proximity to the edge of the ring current, estimated from Cluster energetic electron spectrograms, indicating that they are associated with region 2 field-aligned currents. Longer-duration trends in the residuals indicate a slight difference between the model predictions and the Cluster data for various locations and seasons. For example, throughout most of 2003 and the first half of 2004, there is a residual in the total magnetic field for an hour centered on perigee, of ∼20 {nT}.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and experimental developments in the 1920s that accompanied the birth of coincidence methods, as well as later crucial applications during the 1930s and 1940s are presented. In 1924 Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger applied a coincidence method to the study of Compton scattering with Geiger needle counters. Their experiment confirmed the existence of radiation quanta and established the validity of conservation principles in elementary processes. At the end of the 1920s, Bothe and Werner Kolh{\textbackslash}"orster coupled the coincidence technique with the new Geiger-M{\textbackslash}"uller counter to study cosmic rays, marking the start of cosmic-ray research as a branch of physics. The coincidence method was further refined by Bruno Rossi, who developed a vacuum-tube device capable of registering the simultaneous occurrence of electrical pulses from any number of counters with a tenfold improvement in time resolution. The electronic coincidence circuit bearing Rossi's name was instrumental in his research on the corpuscular nature and the properties of cosmic radiation during the early 1930s, a period characterized by a lively debate between Millikan and followers of the corpuscular interpretation. The Rossi coincidence circuit was also at the core of the counter-controlled cloud chamber developed by Patrick Blackett and Giuseppe Occhialini, and became one of the important ingredients of particle and nuclear physics. During the late 1930s and 1940s, coincidences, anti-coincidences and delayed coincidences played a crucial role in a series of experiments on the decay of the muon, which inaugurated the current era of particle physics. {PACS} numbers: 96.50.S-, 84.30.-r, 96.50.S-, 95.85.Ry, 29.40.-n, 13.35.Bv, 45.20.dh, 12.20.-m, 91.25.-r, 29.40.Cs, 13.20.-v, 14.60.Ef, 14.60.Cd, 78.70.Bj, 20.00.00, 95.00.00, 01.60.+q, 01.85.+f, 01.65.+g},

	abstract = {Over recent years there has been marked growth in interest in the study of techniques of cosmic ray physics by astrophysicists and particle physicists. Cosmic radiation is important for the astrophysicist because in the farther reaches of the universe. For particle physicists, it provides the opportunity to study neutrinos and very high energy particles of galactic origin. More importantly, cosmic rays constitue the background, and in some cases possibly the signal, for the more exotic unconfirmed hypothesized particles such as monopoles and sparticles. Concentrating on the highest energy cosmic rays, this book describes where they originate, acquire energy, and interact, in accreting neutron stars, supernova remnants, in large-scale shock waves. It also describes their interactions in the atmosphere and in the earth, how they are studied in surface and very large underground detectors, and what they tell us.},

	abstract = {Level set techniques are numerical techniques for tracking the evolution of interfaces. They rely on two central embeddings; first, the embedding of the interface as the zero level set of a higher dimensional function, and second, the embedding (or extension) of the interface's velocity to this higher dimensional level set function. This paper applies Sethian's Fast Marching Method, which is a very fast technique for solving the eikonal and related equations, to the problem of building fast and appropriate extension velocities for the neighboring level sets. Our choice and construction of extension velocities serves several purposes. First, it provides a way of building velocities for neighboring level sets in the cases where the velocity is defined only on the front itself. Second, it provides a subgrid resolution not present in the standard level set approach. Third, it provides a way to update an interface according to a given velocity field prescribed on the front in such a way that the signed distance function is maintained, and the front is never re-initialized; this is valuable in many complex simulations. In this paper, we describe the details of such implementations, together with speed and convergence tests and applications to problems in visibility relevant to semi-conductor manufacturing and thin film physics.},

Several experimentalist tried to identify the origin of this radiation and in particular Victor Franz Hess, Theodor Wulf and Domenico Pacini. Among them Domenico Pacini had a crucial role to address the answer to the origin of this radiation in the right way, and V.F.{\textasciitilde}Hess performed the complete set of measurements that definitively excluded an origin connected to the soil radioactive elements. However the most interesting and may be surprising point it that these pioneers defined 1 century ago the three experimental lines to study the Cosmic Rays: from space, on ground and underground and using only electroscopes. Domenico Pacini in particular may be considered the pioneer of the underground measurements on Cosmic Rays and Hess with his set of systematic measurements with balloon flights, originated the air-space studies on Cosmic Rays.},
